DO:

* Test the script itself -> need some print -> "-d --debug" mode

* Make structural tests -> like convert a tree to json, and compare the result.
* Parameterized test -> Some times, certain value can only be obtained in runtime

* Above two can be easily solved by introduce a simple `[[ primary name | structural = t | parameter = a]]`

Don't do:

* Multiple files: no, this can be done via a shell script.
